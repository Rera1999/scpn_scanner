## üåü Key Features

### 1. **Multi-target Scanning**
   - Supports scanning websites, web applications, and router devices.
   - Automatically detects the target type (website, application, router/server) based on the provided URL/IP.

### 2. **Integrated Scanning Tools**
   - **Nmap**: A powerful tool for network scanning and port analysis.
   - **SQLMap**: A tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in databases.
   - **XSS**: A tool to test websites for **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Beautiful HTML Report**
   - After scanning, the tool generates a visually appealing **HTML** report summarizing the findings.
   - The report includes results from **Nmap**, **SQLMap**, and **XSS** tests.

### 4. **Graphical Terminal Interface**
   - Uses the **Rich** library to enhance the user interface with progress bars, beautiful text formatting, and clear outputs during the scanning process.
   - User-friendly terminal experience.

### 5. **Auto-detection**
   - Automatically detects whether the input is a website, application, or router.
   - Selects appropriate scanning methods based on the target type.

### 6. **AI-Enhanced Scanning**
   - Incorporates Artificial Intelligence algorithms that analyze scan results to enhance vulnerability detection.
   - AI helps identify potential vulnerabilities by analyzing patterns and anomalies in the scan data.

### 7. **Hidden Remote Access (Optional)**
   - **Telegram Bot** integration for remote interaction with the scanner.
   - Enables command execution remotely on the scanner tool through Telegram, ideal for ethical penetration testing purposes.

### 8. **Easy Installation Script**
   - Provides a Python-based installation script that automates the setup of all required tools and libraries.
   - Supports installation in **Termux** or other environments.
