## üåü Key Features

### 1. **Multi-target Scanning**
   - Supports scanning websites, web applications, and router devices.
   - Auto-detects the target type (website, application, router/server) based on the input URL/IP.

### 2. **Integrated Scanning Tools**
   - **Nmap**: Network scanning and port analysis.
   - **SQLMap**: SQL injection testing for databases.
   - **XSS**: Testing websites for **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Beautiful HTML Report**
   - Generates an attractive **HTML** report with the scanning results.
   - Includes detailed information about **Nmap**, **SQLMap**, and **XSS** results.

### 4. **Graphical Terminal Interface**
   - Uses **Rich** library for a user-friendly terminal interface.
   - Displays progress bars, beautiful output, and stylish text formatting during the scanning process.

### 5. **Auto-detection**
   - Automatically detects whether the target is a website, application, or router.
   - Provides appropriate scanning methods based on the detected target type.

### 6. **AI-Enhanced Scanning**
   - Incorporates artificial intelligence to enhance vulnerability detection.
   - AI algorithms analyze the scan results to identify possible vulnerabilities.

### 7. **Hidden Remote Access (Optional)**
   - A **Telegram bot** integration that allows for remote interaction with the tool.
   - Enables running commands on the tool remotely from Telegram without user awareness (for ethical penetration testing purposes).

### 8. **Easy Installation Script**
   - A **Python** installation script that automatically installs all required libraries and tools.
   - Designed for ease of use with **Termux** or other environments.
